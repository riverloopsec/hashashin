<h4 id="by-jonathan-prokos-august-2023">By Jonathan Prokos | August
2023</h4>
<p>Our last blog post on Hashashin was almost four years ago<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>; since then the entire tool has been
redesigned. As Hashashin is being transitioned into other work, it is
time we provide an updated blog post outlining the approaches we tried
and lessons learned through the process of developing this tool.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-what-is-hashashin">tldr; What is Hashashin?</h2>
<p>Hashashin utilizes statistical methods to compare functions within a
binary. This allows us to identify similar functions across binaries.
This is useful for identifying code reuse, malware, and other
interesting properties of binaries.</p>
<p>You may find this tool useful if you are interested in: - Identifying
the libraries used within a binary + their versions - Identifying code
reuse across binaries - Matching unknown binaries to known binaries -
Quickly identifying differences between patched binaries - Performing
any of these tasks at scale</p>
<h2 id="previous-approach">Previous Approach</h2>
<p>Our previous approach utilized Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> along with the Weisfeiler Lehman
Isomorphism Test (WLI)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to produce a graph representation of
the basic blocks within a function which was used to compute similarity.
While this approach works in theory, in practice this does not scale
well.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of this blog post I will go over my thought
process and decisions made while redesigning Hashashin.</p>
<h2 id="background-motivation">Background / Motivation</h2>
<p>The primary focus when redesigning Hashashin was performance. While
WLI provides an accurate estimate of graph similarity, it is far too
slow for our application - scaling exponentially with the number of
functions stored in the database.</p>
<p>While graph isomorphism is not able to handle these problems at
scale, the idea of using LSH - also referred to as “fuzzy hashing” -
remains at the core how Hashashin operates. The first step to
redesigning this software was to perform a literature review of the
current SoA in fuzzy hashing.</p>
<h3 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h3>
<p>The most common use case of similar tools is in detecting malware and
plagarism detection. Some of the papers I reviewed - in no particular
order - during this process are listed below. Note many of the links
have deprecated in the 8 months since access and most papers have minor
differences between the published version and the version I read.</p>

</ol>
<p>Of these papers, BinSign<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> best encapsulated the
design goals of this Hashashin refactor. In particular, we move away
from a test of graph similarity to a comparison of extracted features.
Additionally, the paper describes a methodology for generating a
candidate set of similar functions which can be generated using a more
efficient algorithm for which a deeper comparison can be utilized in a
second step.</p>
<p>These ideas gave rise to the notion of a tiered hashing system in
which a BinarySignature - consisting of many FunctionFeatures - can be
compared against a database of other signatures efficiently using the
minhash algorithm<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Many ideas for which features to
use come from <em>Efficient features for function matching between
binary executables by Karamitas &amp; Kehagias</em><a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="initial-design">Initial Design</h2>
<p>The first step to implementing this redesign is to develop a set of
features which can be extracted from a function. While this list is
configurable to the use case, by default<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Hashashin extracts the following features using the BinaryNinja API<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: - Cyclomatic Complexity<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> - Number of Instructions - Number of
Strings - Maximum String Length - Vertex Histogram - Edge Histogram -
Instruction Histogram - Dominator Signature - Extracted Constants -
Extracted Strings</p>
<p>The extracted vertex and edge histograms are modifications of the
solution posed in §IV.A of Karamitas<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. The dominator
signature is an exact implementation of what Karamitas calls <em>digraph
signatures</em> from §IV.B. The instruction histogram relies on
BinaryNinja’s MLIL.</p>
<p>Note the last two features - constants and strings - are just the
first 64 and 512 bytes of a sorted list of the extracted feature
respectively. This is done to create a staticly sized feature vector to
compute matrix norms.</p>
<p>Once all function features have been computed, we use the minhash
algorithm<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> to generate a BinarySignature which
can be used to efficiently estimate jaccard similarity between other
BinarySignatures.</p>
<h3 id="comparison">Comparison</h3>
<p>Under this tiered system we now have two ways to compare binaries:
<code>--fast-match</code> and <code>--robust-match</code>. These options
utilize both the minhash similarity estimate and true jaccard similarity
respectively<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. The former relies on the minhash
generated BinarySignature. For the latter comparison, we compute
similarity using matrix norms<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. This returns a score
between 0 and 2 for a collection of functions against another collection
of functions. For estimating version, we compute this similarity between
the candidate binary and the dataset of binaries each with their
respective collection of functions.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-work">Does it work?</h3>
<p>Yup, look at that graph! Our initial target for what this tool can be
utilized for is identifying the unknown version of a known binary. To
test this, we collect a dataset of adjacent binaries - including
<code>net-snmp</code>, <code>libcurl</code>, and
<code>openssl</code>.</p>
<p>Under <code>net-snmp</code>, we find that the
<code>--fast-match</code> option works surprisingly well at determining
not only the adjacent version for an unknown binary, but also its name
under <code>net-snmp</code> (i.e. <code>agentxtrap</code>). However when
introducing <code>libcurl</code> and <code>openssl</code> into the mix
we find significant mismatching. We hypothesize this is due to
<code>net-snmp</code> being a much smaller binary and therefore has far
fewer “empty” functions. This is a problem which is addressed during our
Elasticsearch upgrade which I will speak of later. A demo of these
issues is shown in the <a
href="https://github.com/riverloopsec/hashashin/blob/develop/README.md#demo-usage">Hashashin
readme</a> along with additional figures.</p>
<p>Despite the troubles with <code>--fast-match</code> false positives,
the <code>--robust-match</code> comparison works very well. The
following graphic shows the similarity between pairwise comparisons of
60 <code>libcurl</code> binaries (gathered from v7.8 through v7.84.0):
<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riverloopsec/hashashin/develop/libcurl_similarity_matrix.png"
alt="libcurl_similarity_matrix" /></p>
<p>Ignoring the outliers - likely due to version string ordering &amp;
major version differences - we see a very strong correlation between
adjacent versions of <code>libcurl</code>. This shows that given an
unknown version of <code>libcurl</code> we can match it to a known
version with a high degree of confidence. This is a very promising
result for Hashashin’s future.</p>
<h4 id="transition">Transition</h4>
<p>Given the results shown above, we begin looking to transition the
Hashashin tool into other platforms at this point. Our first target for
this transition is to utilize Hashashin within a platform called Pilot<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. This is a COTS platform aimed to
help developers and device vendors detect and remediate vulnerabilities
in their firmware. The goal of this transition is to utilize Hashashin
to pin potential <code>net-snmp</code> binaries to a known version with
the intention of cross-referencing those versions against a database of
known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>While this work transitioned successfully, it highlighted a few
issues with Hashashin moving forwards.</p>
<h3 id="growing-pains">Growing Pains</h3>
<p>At this point in Hashashin’s development, we rely on a SQLAlchemy
database. This is great because we can use ORMs to quickly swap out our
backend, but SQL has quickly become a major hindrance to Hashashin’s
effectiveness. The largest issue with this current design - as shown in
our Pilot transition - is the database recovery time before we even
begin to perform comparisons. As a hotfix for the Pilot use-case, we
instead store the <code>net-snmp</code> database as their respective
numpy arrays to-be-compared in a pickle file. This is a major
improvement in comparison time, but it is not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>Before we transition the Hashashin tool into other platforms we look
into a full database redesign. Namely, we look to perform the bulk of
similarity comparisons at the database level rather than the application
level. This is where we begin to look into Elasticsearch<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="current-design">Current Design</h2>
<p>In addition to transitioning Hashashin into Pilot, we look to
integrate the tool into an A.I.-assisted reverse engineering platform to
perform Binary Similarity Analysis. As the platform already utilizes
Elasticsearch for much of its other processes, it is a natural fit to
integrate into Hashashin.</p>
<h3 id="elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</h3>
<p>At a high level, Elasticsearch is able to perform similarity
comparisons between documents using a vector space model. While this
provides some speedup to the <code>--fast-match</code> process, it
provides very significant speedups to <code>--robust-match</code> which
performs comparisons at the function level. When using Elasticsearch, we
completely remove the <code>--fast-match</code> option and implement a
generic <code>match</code><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> function.</p>
<h4 id="elasticsearch-mapping">Elasticsearch Mapping</h4>
<p>In order to utilize Elasticsearch for our comparisons, we must first
define a mapping for our documents. Elasticsearch utilizes a flat
document structure for lookups meaning we need to create a parent-child
relationship between Binaries and their respective FunctionFeatures.
Additionally, we decide to create <code>static_properties</code> as a
feature vector which does not include the extracted strings or constants
such that we can compare those features after the initial knn return.
Our mapping can be found in <a
href="https://github.com/riverloopsec/hashashin/blob/e5da28fc85d4643ede1e46df3b6ec9e76106e402/hashashin/elasticsearch.py#L110-L169">ElasticSearchHashRepository.create</a>;
note all properties to be searched over must be stored at the top level
of the mapping for knn-search. This means the notion of Binaries and
Functions are both stored in the ES database as a single document type
and <code>bin_fn_relation</code> notates which of the two the document
is.</p>
<h4 id="the-match-query">The Match Query</h4>
<p>Now that we have a mapping, we can search over the database using
knn-search. Below is pseudocode of our match query (full code here<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>):</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Given a BinarySignature which contains a functionFeatureList
search_list = functions in functionFeatureList with cyclomatic complexity &gt; 1
bulk_search = []
for each func in search_list:
    header = {&quot;index&quot;: self.config.index}
    body = dict knn -&gt; field = static_properties
    add header and body to bulk_search
call msearch to search all queries
match_counts = dict()
for each response:
    get closest hits by score
    factor in constants and strings to update scores
    if there is a tie for closest hit, randomly choose one
    add the closest hit to match_counts and record its score
Update scores to be a percentage of total score
Return the top 5 matches sorting by the updated scores</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we first query the <code>static_properties</code> to
return the top 5 closest hits for each function in the candidate binary
then filter that down to get a closest match using the strings and
constants. We then use those results to determine the likelihood the
candidate binary belongs to a pre-computed binary already in the
database based on how many of its functions match to the one stored in
the db.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>In addition to general development fixes, there are a few key
directions future Hashashin work can involve.</p>
<h4 id="performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</h4>
<p>Hashashin has not been largely tested at scale as the REPO
integration is ongoing. A major area of investigation to address is to
determine which features are the most strongly correlated with
true-positive matches. This will naturally facilitate additional feature
extraction and more fine-tuned comparisons.</p>
<h4 id="feature-extraction">Feature Extraction</h4>
<p>Hashashin currently relies on BinaryNinja to perform its extraction
of functions and their respective features. A major hurdle for
integrating this tool into other tools comes from the BinaryNinja
licensing issues. Future work to implement a Ghidra extraction engine
will alleviate this issue and allow Hashashin to be transitioned into
more products at scale.</p>
<h4 id="plugin-development">Plugin Development</h4>
<p>Hashashin currently has a really terrible BinaryNinja plugin, it
would be really nice to introduce this tool into the workflow of a
reverse engineer.</p>
<h4 id="library-detection">Library Detection</h4>
<p>We implement a <code>net-snmp</code> detector using Hashashin for our
integration into Pilot, however there has not been much work into
generalizing this process. A critical area of future work is to develop
a system for generating a database of libraries to be used for this
similarity analysis.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-how-can-you-use-this">Conclusion / How Can You Use
This?</h2>
<p>If you are ingesting an unknown binary and would like to perform
similarity analysis to recover its closest version, determine which
libraries may be contained in the binary, or which parts of the binary
may have changed, Hashashin will be a great tool for you to utilize.</p>
<p>Hashashin will be continuously changing and improving as we integrate
it into more platforms - much of the reason these changes live on a
<code>develop</code> branch. If you are interested in either
